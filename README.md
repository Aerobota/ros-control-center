# ROS Control Center

This control center is a universal tool for controlling robots running ROS. It runs in the browser using a websocket connection and `roslibjs` from [RobotWebTools](http://robotwebtools.org).

## Installation & Tutorial

Please see the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/gaug-cns/ros-control-center/wiki).


## Contributing

For development, [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) needs to be installed on your local computer. Gulp depends on the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) package manager [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com), which is installed via Node.js itself. Via `npm install` it will automatically download all development dependencies (from `package.json`). Type `gulp` in the terminal for concatenation of JS files and `gulp js-lint` for linting.

Contributions are always welcome!
